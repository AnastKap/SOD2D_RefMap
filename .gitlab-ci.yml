## This coonfigures the pipelines for SOD2D, still under coonstruction!

## Define and configure the OS to use for the jobs

## List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
stages:
    - build
    - test

## Confgure the build jobs

# build-GNU-Debug job configuration
build-GNU-Debug:
    stage: build
    script:
        - echo "Compiling the code..."
        # Add a build folder and enter it
        - mkdir build && cd build
        # Run CMake
        - cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
        # Run make
        - make
        - echo "Compile complete."

# This job runs in the test stage.
unit-test-job:
  stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
  script:
    - echo "Running unit tests..."
    - echo "Testing complete!"

code-coverage-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
  stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
  script:
    - echo "Checking code coverage..."
    - echo "Code coverage check complete!"
